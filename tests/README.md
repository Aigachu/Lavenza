# Tests Folder
This folder will be used by developers planning to contribute to Lavenza.

To setup the tests folder, simply run the following at the root of the repository.

```
lavenza provision;
npm run dev;
```

For the installation directory, enter **tests/lavenza**.

The rest can be configured to your liking.

Make sure that you actually set up bots between the provision and summoning to actually test!
