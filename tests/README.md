# Tests Folder
This folder will be used by developers planning to contribute to Lavenza.

To setup the tests folder, simply run the following at the root of the repository.

```
npm link;
lavenza provision; # Set installation root to 'tests/lavenza'.
lavenza summon;
```

Make sure that you actually set up bots between the provision and summoning.
