# Lavenza II

Lavenza II is a large development project aiming to create powerful, multi-platform chatbots!

The main focus right now is Discord development, but all code will be written with the idea in mind that
future clients will be supported (and even communication between clients through a single command).

## Quickstart Guide

There are many different ways to use Lavenza, but the one thing to try out first would be to get a Bot up and running.

You can start by copying the `/app/bots/example` folder into a new folder with the name of your bot in lowercase.

i.e. `/app/bots/lavenza`

The name's Aigachu. You may or may not know me. But that's unimportant.

I've made many bots over the last few years. Many of which were dirty, code
wise. This project is sort of a...Battle! A personal battle to make a clean,
fun application. Hopefully I can look back at this code in
a few years and not cringe or fight back puke. But chances are I will if things go the way they always do. Haha!

My goal with this project is to make bot development easy and scalable.
I also want to be proud of a project and see it to the end for once...
Let's see how far I get with this one!

A few months ago, I decided I wanted to make my best Discord bot in PHP. This
quickly changed as I realized that PHP would probably not be the best
solution if I planned on making bots that would be compatible with a bunch of
different platforms.
 
This original PHP project was named Lavenza. This brings
me to the name of this project. Lavenza II. It's the successor to this PHP project
and looks to follow clean design patterns as much as possible, despite Javascript's
tendency to be more procedural...That in itself is a battle, but it's not impossible!

In any case...I don't even know why I'm writing a preface. Enjoy the code!
