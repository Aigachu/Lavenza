# User Eminences Configuration.
# Users in Lavenza are managed as a simple hierarchy with 5 different Eminences. Here are the official names of them:
#
# None -> Aficionado -> Confidant -> Thief -> Joker
# As we go up in the chain, higher eminences will have higher permissions. When developing Talents, each Command can
# have an "Access Eminence" specified, which determines which eminences have access to the Command. A eminence that is
# above others will be able to access everything the eminences under it can.
#
# {None}
# Simply base level users.
#
# {Aficionado}
# Level 1 users. Usually have access to commands that can edit features in a server, but not add or delete.
#
# {Confidant}
# Level 2 users. Usually have access to commands that can add/delete features in a server.
#
# {Thief}
# Level 3 users. They are the highest authority for the bot and will usually have access to all commands.
#
# As in the example below, add entries that take up a TWITCH_USERNAME: EMINENCE_ID format. The entries added here will be
# the baseline configuration. Additional configurations can be customized later on per twitch channel.

  TWITCH_USERNAME: Aficionado
