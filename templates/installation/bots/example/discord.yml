# Joker
# The Joker is you, the master of the Bot. Enter your own Discord User ID here.
# The easiest way to get your Discord User ID is to set your Discord in Developer's Mode through the Appearance settings.
# You will then be able to right-click your avatar (or anyone's avatar) and get their ID with the 'Copy ID' option.
# There can only be 1 Joker. You have access to all commands and some core commands will send some important info
# to you and you only!

# User Eminences Configuration.
# Users in Lavenza are managed as a simple hierarchy with 5 different Eminences. Here are the official names of them:
#
# None -> Aficionado -> Confidant -> Thief -> Joker
# As we go up in the chain, higher eminences will have higher permissions. When developing Talents, each Command can
# have an "Access Eminence" specified, which determines which eminences have access to the Command. A eminence that is
# above others will be able to access everything the eminences under it can.
#
# {None}
# Simply base level users.
#
# {Aficionado}
# Level 1 users. Usually have access to commands that can edit features in a server, but not add or delete.
#
# {Confidant}
# Level 2 users. Usually have access to commands that can add/delete features in a server.
#
# {Thief}
# Level 3 users. They are the highest authority for the bot and will usually have access to all commands.
#
# As in the example below, add entries that take up a DISCORD_USER_ID: EMINENCE_ID format. The entries added here will be
# the baseline configuration. Additional configuration can be set per discord server.
userRoles:
  DISCORD_USER_ID: Aficionado
