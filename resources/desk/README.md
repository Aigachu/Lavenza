# Lavenza Desk
Hello there! This is a basic starter kit for your Lavenza Desk. It was likely generated by Lavenza!

It contains the necessary folder structure for what we call the **Desk**, which is the main set of files
and folders Lavenza will use to run your bots! This **Desk** will be contain things like your Bot's configurations,
sensitive information (that WON'T be tracked in Git!) and more. 

This **Desk** must be located in your application when you are using Lavenza as a dependency through NPM. The folder
containing this structure can be placed anywhere in your codebase, as long as you tell Lavenza where it is when you fire
the `initialize()` function!

```javascript
// Require Lavenza.
const Lavenza = require('lavenza');

// Initialize Lavenza, telling them where the desk is!
Lavenza.initialize('/path/to/desk/directory');

// Start Lavenza will all configurations ALREADY DONE in the Desk.
Lavenza.summon();
```
