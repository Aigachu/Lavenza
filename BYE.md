> ...Oh! Hi! Didn't see you there.
>
>The name's Aigachu. You may or may not know me. But that's unimportant.
>
>I've made many bots over the last few years. Many of which were dirty, code
wise. This project is sort of a...Battle! A personal battle to make a clean,
fun application. Hopefully I can look back at this code in
a few years and not cringe or fight back puke. But chances are I will if things go the way they always do. Haha!
>
>My goal with this project is to make bot development easy and scalable.
I also want to be proud of a project and see it to the end for once...
Let's see how far I get with this one!
>
>A few months ago, I decided I wanted to make my best Discord bot in PHP. This
quickly changed as I realized that PHP would probably not be the best
solution if I planned on making bots that would be compatible with a bunch of
different platforms.
>
>This original PHP project was named Lavenza. This brings
me to the name of this project. Lavenza II. It's the successor to this PHP project
and looks to follow clean design patterns as much as possible, despite Javascript's
tendency to be more procedural...That in itself is a battle, but it's not impossible!
>
>In any case...I don't even know why I'm writing a preface. Enjoy the code!

> ...OH! Hello again!
>
> I almost typoed that as 'Hell again'! LOL! Now wouldn't THAT be a mood.
>
> So don't ask me why I'm writing another one of these. Maybe I just enjoy talking to myself. BUT HEY. It's fun to have
a nice record of how I've been feeling along the evolution of Lavenza. :) I'm sure I'll come back and read this in a few
months and cringe. HAHA. But WHATEVER!
>
> Lavenza's still going along strong. It's funny to think back to the original PHP version of it. Heck, it's even funnier
to reminisce about Colette, my first ever Discord Bot. For the amount of features she had (which funnily enough is not
far from the amount of features Lavenza has!), the code was ATROCIOUS. All written in ONE file, spanning about 1000 lines.
But you know what? Colette was working. She was live, in quite a few servers back when Discord was the new hotness and bots
were just beginning to be developed.
>
> Lavenza is quite different from that. It just goes to show how much I've evolved as a developer. I won't say I'm a god.
Far from that, actually. I'm sure I have a lot to learn still. But I'm quite proud of how things turned out. I'm sure there
are savants out there that can do what I did in a much cleaner, more efficient way. But I'm just happy to have something I
can say I made, and be proud of it.
>
> Lavenza III is on the horizon! We went from PHP to Javascript, and while it was a nice switch, Javascript just wasn't
cutting it when I wanted to do some GOOD OOP. I had to wrestle with Javascript to achieve OOP, and to be fair I kind of did
achieve it. As much as I could really (except when I got impatient!). But it's time for a new step. Typescript baby. The dawn
of a new era!
>
> It's fun to think about where things will head in the next few months or years. Back when I wrote the last preface, and for
quite some time afterwards, I would always ask myself how I could make Lavenza even cleaner than I already had. Now the doors
have opened for much more, and in the months to come I feel like I'll find even more ways to improve this project. Maybe we'll
switch to another programming language AGAIN! Who knows what the future holds!
>
> Alright, I think I've written enough. Let's get back to work! :D
>
> As always, ENJOY THE CODE!

> So...One year huh. Wow.
>
> Here I am in Greece, at 7:45 AM, typing up another preface for this project. I must really cherish Lavenza. HAHA.
>
> Hello again! Welcome to yet another entry in what seems to be a chronicle of the development of this framework of mine,
where I empty my thoughts and think about the future. HAHA. Trust me, this is more therapeutic than it seems.
>
> I find it funny how the last entry was two months ago and I ended with "Lavenza III is on the horizon!". Truth is, we're
already at Lavenza IV. The changes I made after dropping version III were...Huge, to say the least. But man is Lavenza IV clean.
>
> Lavenza feels even more like a framework now. There are mountains of work to do until I can truly say that the project is complete,
but in its current state it's definitely usable and accomplishes A LOT. Making multiple bots has never been easier for me, and I've done
so much. Bash commands for an interactive process...Service container logic to allow for intricate feature development...God, so much.
>
> By day, I work a 9 to 5 as a Drupal developer. Anyone that has touched Drupal will **feel** its inspiration when looking at the inner
workings of the framework. I inspired myself from Drupal a lot, or at least the good parts of it. But it just makes me wonder...How many
more technologies will I touch in the next few years? And how many of them will inspire me enough that I bleed its essence into this project?
>
> Exciting, honestly. To think about how Lavenza V or Lavenza VI will look. But for now, I think we're good.
>
> As I love to say, I'm no god nor do I even consider myself a good developer. There are excellent developers out there that enjoy it more
and are miles better at it than I am. But I just realize how important it is to do something, for yourself, and to be proud of it.
>
> Chances are Lavenza IV will be the running version for awhile. Far longer than version III's lifecycle! LOL! But it isn't because I have nothing
left to do. There is still a lot to be done, a lot to improve and clean up. Hell, more clients to configure and cover support for. But version IV
is where we'll do a lot of stabilization. We'll clean up some code, we'll do some bugfixes, and we'll try to make it absolutely amazing.
>
> In its current state, even if Lavenza is usable, it's not something I would reveal to the public yet. But I want version V to be just that. Stable
and good enough for me to make others use it. And that's going to be the goal starting now.
>
> What's even more exciting though...Another project has begun. The first official project of mine to make use of Lavenza: [Estrella](https://github.com/Aigachu/Estrella).
>
> ...Why am I even adding a link there? It's a private project! HAHA. But hey, if you have access to that, then know that it's an honor to work with you.
>
> All of this being said, I look forward to seeing where Lavenza goes. And I'm going to continue enjoying the ride.
>
> ...Anyways, it's time for enjoy the rest of my time in Athens. Next preface? When Lavenza V drops.
>
> See you then.

# ***- June 29, 2022 - Byebye Lavenza! -***

> It's time to say goodbye to this amazing project of mine. :'(
>
> Now I won't make this as long as the other entries here. I just want to say a nice farewell to this hobby-project that
> turned into something way bigger than I expected. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but it became a little too big!
>
> Diving back into the code 4 years later made me realize just how far I'd taken it. I got carried away and forgot one
> of the most important development principles that a past manager once taught me: KISS.
>
> Keep It Stupid Simple.
>
> The first time I knew I had gone too far was when someone asked me this question: "Hey Aiga, what's Lavenza?".
>
> I didn't know what to say really. "Lavenza isn't a bot". That's the first thought that came to mind.
>
> Y'know, when you have a hard time explaining your own project to others, you may have an issue. LOL!
>
> Lavenza was a perfect tool for me, myself and I. But I designed it with the purpose of making bot development easier.
> This was a long arduous task. It started with me wanting to plug a bot to both Twitch & Discord, and it turned into me
> adding Google Translation, message personalizations, permissions per guilds and twitch channels, essentially
> replicating Drupal's Services, Plugins & Event Subscriber systems, rewriting everything in Typescript...
>
> It never ENDED!
>
> I DID achieve my goal in the end though. But it went so far that only I knew how much easier it made bot development.
> Anyone else that would attempt to use it would easily get lost in the sauce, to say the least.
>
> Version 5 never came and it never will. Instead, I've started a new project from scratch. Currently a private one, but
> we'll see where it goes. With Discord being way different from it was 4 years ago, there are a myriad of new
> possibilities. And it's the main reason why I decided to leave Lavenza behind: She was heavily tuned to the archaic
> way of things. Using prefixes for bot commands (Which I'll still have to do on Twitch unfortunately LOL), having a
> file storage database, among other things.
>
> So as I type this, while I do feel a little sad to let Lavenza go...I'm also excited for what comes next.
>
> This next project will be way simpler and optimized. No more confusing class names. No more convoluted systems.
>
> It's just going to be straight to the point. You get your bot token. You create a couple of classes for commands. And
> boom. You're up and running.
>
> I'll be losing a lot of cheery-picky extensive customization options, but I'll be gaining something invaluable: The
> ability to easily bring along friends for the ride.
>
> Cause everything is better with friends, right?
>
> Thank you for everything, Lavenza. :)
>
> .....Why the heck am I still writing these LOL!
>
> I'll see you guys around. PEACE!
